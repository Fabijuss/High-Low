## I. Epics and User Stories
 ### I.1. Epic
  This is a game where the player rolls a 10-sided dice and guesses whether the number they rolled is higher or lower than the number the computer picks.
 ### I.2 User Stories
 #### I.2.1 Number generation
 The computer must generate a random number between 1 and 10(inclusive), then display it to the user. 
 #### I.2.2 Input
 The player must be able to input their choice when the program asks them to pick "higher or lower". There should only be two options, and any other choices should be invalid. The format for the choice must be string in order to avoid errors. 
 #### I.2.3 Win/Lose
 Based on the number the computer picks, and the guess the player chooses, the game should output either a "You win!" or "You lose!" message. If the game ends in a draw, then a "It's a draw!" message should appear instead. The player should now be able to decide whether they wish to play another round or end the game by selecing either "Y" or "N" for Yes and No respectively.
